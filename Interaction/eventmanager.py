# Instructions:
# To register a new event use the register_event function
# Pass a unique event name and a function that will be executed when the event is called
# The function must follow the template function(header list, data list)
# How the function handles the header and data can be handled at the function definition

# To call a function use the call_event function with the event string, header and data arguments
